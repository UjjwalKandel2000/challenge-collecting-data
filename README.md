- Price
- Type of sale (Exclusion of life sales)
- Number of rooms
- Area
- Fully equipped kitchen (Yes/No)
- Furnished (Yes/No)
- Open fire (Yes/No)
- Terrace (Yes/No)
  - If yes: Area
- Garden (Yes/No)
  - If yes: Area
- Surface of the land
- Surface area of the plot of land
- Number of facades
- Swimming pool (Yes/No)
- State of the building (New, to be renovated, ...)

All these datasets are saved in ```property_data.csv``` file.

While saving the datasets, we used python libraries ;

 - import time
 - import json
 - import pandas as pd
